# Why is this here
I want this to be a online collaborative platform for creating both the context, potential solutions, and plans for stabilizing the climate. Ask questions, make comments, pull requests, fork this, let's go.

# About me
I've been working on reversing climate change for nearly a decade. I've been recently working on clarifying what the current state of the climate is, what a stable climate looks like, and pathways to getting there.

# What this isn't
At this draft, context.md likely looks like some guy trying to justify injecting dust into the sky. context.md also currently mixes planning elements into what is best as a factual document, separate from options.md and plan.md. And there's a bunch of places where I literally say "need sources". Clearly this could use a lot of help, and this is where I'm starting. The intent is to create the context, potential solutions, and plans for stabilizing the climate.

# Next steps
I want lots of feedback about the context.md file. Read it. Each line of context.md is a thesis. Start at the top and work your way down.
1. What is the first line you find yourself at all disagreeing with and why? Start as high on the list as you can, i.e. what's most valuable is your disagreement on point #5 vs point #10.
2. What are we missing? Are there lines we're missing? Add them!
