# Why is this here
I want this to be a online collaborative platform for creating both the context, potential solutions, and plans for reversing climate change. Ask questions, make comments, pull requests, fork this, let's go.

# About me
I've been working on reversing climate change for nearly a decade. I've been working on clarifying my own thinking about my thesis for what the current state of the climate is, what a stable climate looks like, and paths to getting there.

# Next steps
I want lots of feedback about the [[context.md]] file. Each line of context.md is a thesis. Start high up.
Which line do you find yourself disagreeing with and why? Start as high on the list as you can, i.e. what's most valuable is your disagreement on point #5 vs point #10.
What are we missing?
