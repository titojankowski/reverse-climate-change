# Why is this here
I want this to be a online collaborative platform for creating both the context, potential solutions, and plans for stabelizing the climate. Ask questions, make comments, pull requests, fork this, let's go.

# About me
I've been working on reversing climate change for nearly a decade. I've been recently working on clarifying what the current state of the climate is, what a stable climate looks like, and pathways to getting there.

# Next steps
I want lots of feedback about the context.md file. Read it. Each line of context.md is a thesis. Start at the top and work your way down.
1. What is the first line you find yourself at all disagreeing with and why? Start as high on the list as you can, i.e. what's most valuable is your disagreement on point #5 vs point #10.
2. What are we missing? Are there lines we're missing? Add them!
